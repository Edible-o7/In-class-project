## About me

Hello, my name is Eddie Poma and I am a graduate studetnt in the Computer Science master's program at SUNY New Paltz. I have a bachelor's in physics and astronomy. I have only really been in the computer science field in 
the two years I have been in grad school, but I have some familiarity with computers. I have a bit of experience
building computers themselves, and I was introduced to Java programming in one of physics classes called "Computational Physics" where I programmed a physics simulation for free fall problems. Since then, some of my favorite classes that I've taken are Computer Vision and Machine Learning. In Computer Vision, I trained a model to recognize and classify articles of clothing based on a given image and dataset. In Machine Learning, I trained multiple models to classify whether or not an object of interest is an exoplanet based a number of physical features in a given dataset. 

I am very interested in using what I learn in this class to create other web apps. I have little experience with this sort of thing, but I am facinated by the process of developing and applying the knowledge I will gain in this class. I think its pretty cool to see more complicated uses of html and css to develop apps for practical use. It would also be nice to get some hands on experience for this type of programming instead of working on fundamental problems in a textbook.
